# 1-Pound BattleBot Project

This repository contains CAD files and documentation for a 1-pound combat robot designed for competitive mini-battlebot events. The design emphasizes modularity, durability, and functionality using 3D-printed components and off-the-shelf hardware.

## üîß Materials Used

- **3D Printed Parts (PLA)**
- **Acrylic sheets**
- **Wood**
- **Fasteners** (machine screws, wood screws)
- **Superglue**
- **Springs** (3 compression springs for shock absorption)
- **Solder & Heat Shrink Tubing** (for insulated wiring)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical Design

- **Weapon System**: A PLA spinner powered via a pulley and belt mechanism.
- **Mobility**: 2-wheel drive powered by DC gear motors.
- **Actuation**: 
  - 1 √ó 280 DC motor for the spinner
  - 1 √ó DC servo motor for the arm
  - 2 √ó DC gear motors for drive
- **Kill Switch**: Included for emergency shutoff.

## üîã Power System

- 3 √ó **LiPo Batteries** providing a total of **7.4V**
- 1 √ó **Battery Charger**

## üì¶ Repository Contents

- `/CAD/` ‚Äî All 3D models and drawings for the robot components
- `/Schematics/` ‚Äî Wiring diagrams and electrical system overview (if applicable)
- `/Documentation/` ‚Äî Additional documentation such as BOM or design notes

## üìå Notes

This project was developed as a collaborative engineering challenge, focusing on both mechanical design and electronics integration. This repository represents the work of my team and me, including CAD modeling and system design.
